Milestone Delta: Bus fare calculation
In this milestone we are going to calculate the bus fare using the gps coordinates.

 
In this file it has the arrangement of some bus stoppings in Chennai and their fare. The process works in this way. When a person boards from Ashok nagar he taps his card at the Ashok nagar bus stop and when he gets down at CMBT he will again tap the card where using the GPS coordinates it recognizes that he has disembarked at CMBT and the computer will process the bus fare using the bus chart and will deduct the money from his balance.
